# Exploring and Predicting Major League Baseball Game Attendance
For this project, I analyzed publicly accessible data from Kaggle [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephvm/mlb-game-data/data) to understand factors that affect Major League Baseball (MLB) game attendance and built a machine learning model to predict future game attendance. MLB teams need to accurately predict game attendance to help the organization and its teams budget and staff appropriately. Elucidating the drivers of attendance can also help these organizations optimize sales, advertising, and promotional efforts.

### The goal of this project was to examine MLB game attendance to understand factors that may affect it and predict future game attendance using machine learning.
